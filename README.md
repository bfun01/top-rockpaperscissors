# top-rockpaperscissors
TOP Rock Paper Scissors JS project

This project is part of the TOP curriculum and is a simple rock, paper, scissors game.
The project will be played in the console (part 1) and is coded in JS. A user should input "rock", "paper", or "scissors". The code will also randomly pick one of the three choices. The game will message whether the use won, lost, or drew.
